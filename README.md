# Aletheo(LET)

From Greek it's the Bringer of truth from God, or simply God of Truth. Most of the development is now in private repo/background for a bit while

To properly run tests make sure your init code hash for uniswap is valid.

```
git clone https://github.com/SamPorter1984/Aletheo && cd Aletheo && npm run test
```

Because of EIP-3561 specifically designed for Aletheo, refactoring and optimization is not critical as of now, so the recent version of Aletheo smart contracts does not look as nice, as it was before.

You can find EIP-3561 tests in this [repo](https://github.com/SamPorter1984/EIP-3561-tests).

Next version of whitepaper soon, latest is [0.6](https://github.com/SamPorter1984/Aletheo/blob/main/papers/Aletheo%20Whitepaper%200.6.pdf) and has a couple of errors in design.

The browser extension for anonymous imageboards was removed from here and will have a separate repo soon.

Tests for EIP-6228 will be moved to a new repo.
